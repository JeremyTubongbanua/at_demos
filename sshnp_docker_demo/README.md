# sshnp_docker_demo

This demo involves using [sshnp](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/sshnoports). [sshnp](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/sshnoports) allows you ssh into any remote device/host without that device having any open ports.

There are two docker containers: `sshnp` and `sshnpd`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get sshnp working on your machine using Docker.

### 1. Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and open it in the background. Check that you have docker installed. Run this in your terminal. Your output should be similar:

```sh
docker --version
Docker version 23.0.5, build bc4487a
```

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and open it in the background. Check that you have git installed. Run this in your terminal. Your output should be similar:

```sh
git --version
git version 2.39.0
```

3. You will need 2 atSigns and their associated `.atKeys` files, one for each docker container. One atSign will be the client (sshnp) address while the other atSign will be the device (sshnpd) address. See [1A. Getting your .atKeys](#1a-getting-your-atkeys) to learn how to get your atKeys.

4. Git clone this repository, and change into the demo directory to ensure it was cloned properly.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos.git
cd at_demos/sshnp_docker_demo
ls
```

5. Log into Docker, if you are not logged in already:

```sh
docker login
```

#### 1A. Getting your .atKeys

<!-- TODO INCLUDE "GETTING YOUR ATKEYS" VIDEO WHEN IT IS UPLOADED -->

If you already have your `.atKeys` files, you may skip this step.

1. Go to [my.atsign.com/go](https://my.atsign.com/go) and get 2 atSigns.

2. Once purchased, be sure to go through each of them and press the orange "Activate" button. This will open your atSign for activation

3. Use [at_onboarding_cli/at_activate](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_libraries/tree/trunk/packages/at_onboarding_cli) (if you prefer a command-line approach) or download one of our [apps](https://atsign.com/apps/) (such as [atmospherePro](https://atsign.com/apps/atmospherepro/)) to utilize the onboarding widget to generate your `.atKeys` files. You will need to generate a `.atKeys` file for each of your atSigns. Be sure to not lose these keys as they are used to authenticate into an atSign's atServer.

### 2. Setting up the sshnpd Docker Container (Device)

Next, let's set up the sshnpd container.

1. Put your sshnpd atSign's `.atKeys` file in `sshnpd/keys`. Your file structure should be similar to `sshnpd/keys/@alice_key.atKeys`.

2. Open up a fresh terminal.

3. Run the `docker-build.sh` script inside of `sshnpd/`. 

```sh
cd sshnpd
./docker-build.sh
```

You may need to `chmod +x docker-build.sh` to make the script executable.

You may need to enter your user password to allow the script to run `sudo` commands. 

If run successfully, your terminal session should be running the docker container. Output should be similar to:

```sh
...
atsign@c602e7e77fa9:~$ 
```

4. Run the `./install_sshnpd` script

```sh
cd sshnp
./install_sshnpd
```

Example:

```sh
atsign@244ecc19dcca:~$ cd sshnp/
atsign@244ecc19dcca:~/sshnp$ ./install_sshnpd
Client address (e.g. @alice_client): @soccer99
Device address (e.g. @alice_device): @22easy
Device name: docker
```

This will install and run the sshnpd inside of the docker container.

5. View the tmux session

Optionally, you may run `tmux a` to see logs.

```sh
tmux a
```

You should see a line similar to the following, if the daemon started successfully:

```
INFO|2023-06-07 16:13:34.097561|Monitor (@22easy)|monitor started for @22easy with last notification time: null 
```

Once the daemon is running successfully, you may move onto [Step 3. Setting up the sshnp Docker Container (Client)](#3-setting-up-the-sshnp-docker-container-client).

The next step is for setting up the daemon manually in case something goes wrong. Exiting the Docker container via `Ctrl + D` and restarting from step 1 can also be done.

6. If the daemon was not started successfully, follow the next steps.

To detach, press `ctrl+b` and then `d`.

Then kill the session

```sh
tmux kill-ses
```

You can either run the install script to try again, or re-run the script the installer generated.

Run the `sshnpd@sshnp_atsign` script inside of `~/.local/bin`. This is a custom script generated by the `install_sshnpd` script.

Replace `@sshnp_atsign` with the atSign you are using for `sshnp`.

```sh
~/.local/bin/sshnpd@sshnp_atsign
```

This will rerun the sshnpd binary.

### 3. Setting up the sshnp Docker Container (Client)

1. Put your sshnp atSign's `.atKeys` inside of `sshnp/keys/`. Your file structure should be similar to `sshnp/keys/@alice_key.atKeys`.

2. Open up a fresh terminal.

3. Next, let's build the `sshnp` docker container using the `docker-build.sh` shell script.

```sh
cd sshnp
./docker-build.sh
```

You may need to `chmod +x docker-build.sh` to make the script executable.

You may need to enter your password to allow the script to run `sudo` commands.

If run successfully, your terminal sesssion should be running the docker container:

```sh
atsign@f868301cecf8:~$ 
```

4. Run the `install_sshnp` script

```sh
cd sshnp ; 
./install_sshnp
```

Example:

```sh
atsign@37dec765a093:~$ cd sshnp/
atsign@37dec765a093:~/sshnp$ ./install_sshnp
Client address (e.g. @alice_client): @soccer99
Device address (e.g. @alice_device): @22easy
Pick your default region:
  am: Americas
  ap: Asia Pacific
  eu: Europe
> am
```

5. Now run the custom sshnp script it generated.

Replace `@sshnpd_atsign` with your sshnpd atSign.

```sh
~/.local/bin/sshnp@sshnpd_atsign docker
```

6. You should receive an ssh command to run after running the `sshnp` script. Copy and run this command.

Running the `sshnp` script should give you an output at the end similar to:

```sh
ssh -p 44743 atsign@localhost -i /atsign/.ssh/id_ed25519 
```

7. You should be ssh'd into the other docker container. (Hurray!)

```sh
atsign@77fe899b6732:~$ ps -a
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
   27 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   76 pts/1    00:00:00 sshnpd@soccer99
   79 pts/1    00:00:01 dart:sshnpd
  224 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
atsign@77fe899b6732:~$ echo yay
yay
```

## Structure

<!-- TODO -->

## The Dockerfile

<!-- TODO -->

## Quick Start

Same as [Getting Started](#getting-started) but a lot quicker.

1. Put your @sshnp atKeys in `sshnp/keys` and @sshnpd atKeys in `sshnpd/keys`

2. Open a new terminal and start the sshnpd docker container

```sh
cd sshnpd ; ./docker-build.sh
```

3. In the sshnpd docker container:

Change `@client` and `@device` accordingly

```sh
cd sshnp ; ./install_sshnpd -c @client -d @device -n docker ; tmux a ; cd ..
```

4. Open another terminal and start the sshnp docker container

```sh
cd sshnp ; ./docker-build.sh
```

5. In the sshnp docker container:

Change `@client`, `@device`, and `am` accordingly

```sh
cd sshnp ; ./install_sshnp -c @client -d @device -h am ; $(~/.local/bin/sshnp@22easy docker) ; cd ..
```

6. Hurray! You should be ssh'd

```sh
ps -a
```
