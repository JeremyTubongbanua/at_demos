# get_started_c

Welcome to the get_started_c demos.

In this directory, you will find demos that show you how to use the C SDK. The "C SDK" goes by many names such as "atSDK", "atClient", "at_c", "client implementation", etc,. But they all mean the same thing, "a client implementation of the atProtocol in C".
